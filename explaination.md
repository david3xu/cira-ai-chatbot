# completion routes 

Let me explain the key differences between the two routes:
Regular Completion Route (app/api/ai/completion/route.ts):
Returns the entire AI response in one go
Waits for the complete response before sending
Better for shorter responses or when you need the full text at once
Uses createSuccessResponse to wrap the completion
Streaming Route (app/api/ai/completion/stream/route.ts):
- Returns tokens one by one as they're generated
Uses ReadableStream for real-time streaming
Better for:
Long responses
Chat-like interfaces
Real-time text generation
Uses createStreamResponse to handle streaming
Main differences:
Response Type: Complete vs Token-by-token
Timing: Wait-for-all vs Real-time
Use Case: Batch processing vs Interactive chat
Client Experience: Single update vs Progressive updates

# completion and context routes
Completion routes are for getting direct AI responses
Context route is for analyzing conversations to understand the context better, which could be used to improve future response
